"""Build the Microsoft 365 Copilot and Google Gemini ports of policymemo.ai.

The canonical files are skills/<name>/SKILL.md. Everything this script writes is
generated from them plus ports/core.md, so a port never forks the method.

Usage, from the repository root:
    python3 tools/build-ports.py                       build into dist/ports/
    python3 tools/build-ports.py --check               validate only, write nothing
    python3 tools/build-ports.py --accept-house-rules  record that ports/core.md has
                                                       been reviewed against the
                                                       current house-rules, then build

Exit codes: 0 built or valid, 1 validation failed, 2 house-rules changed since the
last review of ports/core.md.
