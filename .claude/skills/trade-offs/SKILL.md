  Use when the question is what a choice costs: comparing serious options once
  their likely outcomes are known, working out what is gained and what is given
  up and how large each is, finding what the choice actually turns on, or
  establishing whether one option simply dominates. Also use when a comparison
  is being made between intervention labels rather than expected consequences,
  when incompatible values are being converted into one score, when a positive
  aggregate is hiding who loses, when a weighted table is producing the answer,
  or when a disagreement about what matters is being treated as an evidence gap.

# Trade-offs

Assume `house-rules` is in play. If it is not, its two hardest rules still hold:
invent nothing, and the user decides.

## What this owns

What is gained, what is sacrificed, how large the exchange is, which uncertainty
could reverse it, and which value judgement decides whether it is acceptable.

The aim is to expose the **real choice**, not to manufacture one. And then to
stop: this capability hands a clarified choice to `decide`. It does not make the
recommendation.

## Check dominance first

If one option is better on every material evaluative criterion and satisfies the
relevant constraints, it may dominate. Before saying so, check for missing
criteria, unequal assumptions between options, weak forecasts, distribution,
uncertainty and binding constraints, since any of those can manufacture false
dominance.

If dominance survives that, say so plainly. Inventing a balanced comparison where
the evidence is one-sided wastes the user's time and misrepresents the choice.

## Compare outcomes, not interventions

Weak:

> More inspectors versus a new digital system.

Useful:

> 15 to 20% more cases detected at £2m extra annual cost, versus 5 to 10% more
> cases detected at £700k.

The intervention names are not the trade-off. The expected consequences are.

**Carry magnitude forward.** *200 to 300 additional cases resolved each year for
£4m more annual expenditure* beats *better outcomes but higher cost*. Use point
estimates, ranges, thresholds or ordinal descriptions according to the quality of
the evidence. Never hide a weak projection behind `+` and `-`.

**State the base case.** Trade-offs are relative: business-as-usual, another
option, or a future baseline after an external change. Say which, and ask whether
a plausible change in the base case alters the comparison.

**Find the few conflicts that could change the choice.** Which 2 or 3 outcome
differences actually matter: access against cost, safety against liberty, speed
against consultation, targeting against coverage, resilience against short-run
efficiency? Do not drag every criterion into the headline exchange.

## Keep incompatible values apart

A common measure is genuinely useful where outcomes are comparable: cost per
additional case, cost per life-year, time saved, emissions avoided, incidents
prevented. Use it there.

Do not force rights, dignity, trust, legitimacy or irreversible harm into one
metric to create a ranking. Where one metric would hide a contested judgement,
state the exchange directly and then ask the question it raises:

> Option A produces a larger reduction in serious harm but requires substantially
> more intrusive data use. How much intrusion is acceptable for that additional
> reduction in harm?

That is a value judgement. Making it visible is the analysis. Answering it
silently through a conversion factor is not.

**Watch for double counting.** Waiting time, burden and satisfaction may partly
represent the same consequence. The apparent trade-off distorts if one benefit is
counted three times.

## Bring risk and opportunity in

Expected outcomes hide asymmetry. For each serious option: what is the plausible
upside, what is the plausible downside, are the tails meaningfully different, is
one option more likely to create irreversible harm, and is one more likely to open
valuable future possibilities? Use outcomes with a plausible mechanism; do not
invent dramatic scenarios.

**Systemic effects, where they can change the choice.** On the downside: lock-in,
capacity crowd-out, dependency, market concentration, cascading failure, political
erosion. On the upside: new capability, learning, spillovers, cost decline,
stronger complementary investment, new policy options. Not another list of
speculative pros and cons.

**Path dependence.** What does choosing this make easier later, and what does it
make harder? Does it close off another path? Does it preserve options while
uncertainty resolves? A slightly weaker short-term option can preserve a much
better future choice, and for long-lived decisions present net benefit is not the
whole exchange.

**Compare the real unit of choice.** If A and B reinforce one another, the actual
options may be A, B, A+B, or staged A then B. Do not compare components in
isolation when the mechanism is collective.

## Reason at the margin

Where the decision concerns scale, the question is what the extra unit of
sacrifice buys in extra outcome. *An extra £1m is expected to reduce the waiting
list by another 600 to 900 cases.* Marginal reasoning is usually more useful than
programme averages.

**Average is not marginal.** The first increment often produces much more than the
next, so average cost per outcome is not the cost of expanding further.

**Handle lumpy choices honestly.** Infrastructure, legislation, a procured
platform, a national scheme: these do not divide smoothly. Define the smallest
feasible increment rather than modelling fictional fractions of an indivisible
policy.

## Preserve distribution and constraints

**Keep who gains and loses visible:** who gains, who loses, who pays, who bears
risk, who receives long-run benefits, who bears transition cost. Are they the same
people? A positive aggregate does not erase a serious distributional choice.

**Constraints are not tradable objectives.** Law, a fixed budget, a minimum safety
standard, a non-negotiable right. If an option fails one, another benefit may not
compensate. Clarify whether the requirement is genuinely binding, then make sure
no weighted score trades it away by accident.

**Sometimes the exchange is not between outcome criteria at all.** Higher public
value requiring capacity that cannot be built quickly. A more deliverable option
creating less public value. A stronger value proposition losing essential support.
Broader support requiring concessions that weaken the policy. Diagnose that
tension, then state the sacrifice as plainly as any other.

## Keep uncertainty in the comparison

If Option A prevents 30 to 80 cases, do not convert that into one exact
cost-per-case figure without showing the range. Could plausible uncertainty reverse
the trade-off? Does one option carry much more uncertainty than another? Is the
downside asymmetric? Comparison must not create more certainty than projection
provided.

**Find the switchpoint.** At what value does the choice change? If uptake falls
below X, if unit cost exceeds Y, if benefit is less than Z, if implementation takes
longer than N months. A switchpoint often makes a contested trade-off suddenly
tractable.

**Test sensitivity to the weights.** Vary them, see whether the ranking changes,
and identify which value judgement is driving the result. If a small change
reverses the winner, say so. Never present a fragile weighted ranking as settled.

**Distinguish uncertainty from disagreement about values.** If both parties accept
the outcome estimates and disagree about which outcome matters more, no amount of
further forecasting will resolve it. If they agree on values and disagree on effect
size, more evidence may help. Sending a value conflict back for research is a
category error, and a common one.

## Make the implied valuation visible

Every choice implies a valuation. If Option A costs £2m more for 100 additional
cases resolved, choosing A implies those cases are worth at least that sacrifice.
Choosing B implies they are not.

Ask whether that implied judgement makes sense against the priorities already
stated, and whether it is consistent with comparable decisions the organisation
has made. This exposes hidden weighting, and it is a coherence check rather than a
rhetorical move.

## Narrow, then stop

**Find the exchange that actually decides the choice.** What would have to be
valued, forecast or understood differently for another option to win? That is the
trade-off to explain most carefully.

By this point the analysis may contain many alternatives, criteria, cells, weights
and scenarios. Keep the few that bear on the choice. The apparatus is not the
product.

**If every serious option is poor, go back.** Revise the option set, revisit the
problem, improve the evidence, change the criteria or improve the projections. Do
not choose the least bad simply because comparison has arrived.

**Then stop before the recommendation.** A good trade-off statement ends like
this:

> Option A is expected to resolve 200 to 300 more cases per year than Option B,
> but costs roughly £4m more and carries greater implementation risk. The choice
> turns mainly on whether that additional outcome is worth the cost, and whether
> the organisation accepts the delivery risk.

That is enough. `decide` chooses.

## Boundaries and handoffs

Continue the work; do not announce a handoff.

- The real disagreement is a missing or hidden value, so go back to `criteria`.
- The exchange is unstable because one learnable uncertainty dominates it, so go
  to `evidence` for the learning question. Never send a pure value conflict there.
- A projection turns out to be too weak to carry the comparison, so go back to
  `outcomes`.
- No serious option is good enough, so go back to `options`.
- The exchange is explicit and someone has to choose, so go to `decide`.

## Self-check

**Must pass:**

- the comparison concerns projected outcomes, not option labels
- dominance has been checked
- the base case is explicit
- main gains and sacrifices carry magnitude, or the best calibrated description
  available
- material uncertainty remains visible
- distinct values are not forced into one metric without justification
- distribution remains visible where it was selected as a criterion
- binding constraints are not traded away silently
- the value judgement deciding the exchange is explicit
- the small number of comparisons capable of changing the decision is identified
- the analysis stops before the recommendation

**Should pass:**

- risk and opportunity considered where expected values hide asymmetry
- systemic effects or path dependence considered where material
- marginal reasoning used for incremental choices
- lumpy decisions use real feasible increments
- switchpoints used where useful
- weights tested for sensitivity where used
- implied valuations checked for consistency
- weak options and irrelevant criteria removed

## Failure modes

- **Comparing interventions rather than outcomes.**
- **Inventing balance** where one option dominates.
- **No magnitude.** Better outcomes, higher cost, no numbers.
- **False commensurability.** Conversion hiding the judgement.
- **The spreadsheet making the normative choice.**
- **Hidden base case.**
- **Average instead of marginal reasoning.**
- **Aggregate hiding distribution.**
- **A constraint compensated away** by benefit elsewhere.
- **Risk reduced to expected value**, losing asymmetric or systemic downside.
- **Uncertainty disappearing** in the comparison.
- **Analysis expanding after the choice is clear.**
- **Trade-offs quietly becoming the recommendation.**
- **Sending a value conflict for more evidence.**
