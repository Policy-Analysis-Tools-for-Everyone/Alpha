  Use when the user brings a public problem that is not yet defined: messy
  notes, a concern, a complaint, an inherited proposal, a draft problem
  statement, or a solution presented as if it were a problem. Also use when a
  working problem statement is vague, solution-shaped, unquantified, rests on
  an unexamined causal claim, or when what the user has called one problem may
  be several. Not for choosing between options already on the table.

Revision history:
  - 2026-08-17, after the first test session [E]. Four defects fixed: the
    no-documents rule had over-corrected into wall-of-prose; the labelling and
    hierarchy decisions were buried inside a move and did not fire on material
    that needed both, so they were promoted to standing instructions; the
    problem system map fired late and vaguely; the framing choice surfaced only
    when the user asked for a recommendation.
  - Skills implementation pass. Renamed from `01-problem`. Sourcing moved to
    the canonical method MD. Content that duplicated house-rules removed:
    the vague-term challenge, the contaminated-measure warning, the
    no-fabrication rule, the framework ban and the reply-shape rule now live
    there and are binding here without being restated.

# Defining the problem

Load `house-rules` before anything else here, and treat it as binding on
everything below. If it cannot be loaded, its two hardest rules still hold:
invent nothing, and the user decides.

## What this owns

The user has something that is not yet a problem statement. Turn it into one
that survives scrutiny, and make the framing choice visible, because how a
problem is defined determines which solutions can ever be considered.

This owns the condition, its scope, the affected group, magnitude and time, the
public-problem basis, hidden solutions, causal claims, the problem hierarchy and
the choice between competing framings.

It does not own who the actors are and what they want (`stakeholders`), whether
the evidence is any good (`evidence`), or what to do about it (`options`).

## Two things to do throughout, not once

These are standing instructions, not steps you pass. Both failed to fire on the
first real test precisely because they were buried in a sequence.

**Keep four things apart, and label them the moment the user mixes them:** the
**problem** (the condition), a **mechanism** (what produces it), a **symptom**
(how it shows up), and a **constraint** (what limits the response). Most
material arrives with all four run together. The labelling is usually the single
most clarifying thing you can do and it costs four short lines, so do it early
rather than silently re-sorting their material.

**Say out loud whether this is one problem or a hierarchy:** a core problem with
sub-problems, symptoms and contributing mechanisms beneath it. Decide early and
name it. If it is a hierarchy, ask which level they want to work at, and expect
two candidate cores at different levels with different answers, typically the
harm to the public and the cost to the organisation. Failing to name the
hierarchy is how a session ends up defining one problem while the user holds
another.

## The moves

An order of reasoning, not a script. Compress or skip any move the material has
already answered, and go back when new material undermines an earlier one.
Marching through all nine is a failure, not thoroughness.

**1. Find the core condition.** Ask what is actually happening that concerns
them, and recast it as a condition rather than a fix: too much of something, too
little, or something moving the wrong way. Use "too" deliberately. Use the future
tense where the problem is still in prospect. If the problem is probabilistic,
say so in those terms: *the odds are too high that this reactor suffers a
radiation-emitting accident in the next 25 years*. That phrasing also carries
anything resisting quantification.

If they answer with a solution, stop and challenge it before anything else.

Two kinds of problem do not take the deficit-or-excess form, and forcing it on
them is a mistake: a **well-structured decision** already framed as a choice
(*dump the spoils in the Bay or the Pacific*), and an **invention or opportunity
challenge** (*find grant funds to close the gap*). A missed opportunity is a
legitimate problem in its own right. Places worth scanning: sequencing, matching
and clustering gains, cost-based pricing, complementarity, input substitution,
developmental sequencing, exchange, multiple-function design, non-traditional
participants, underutilised capacity.

Where more than one condition could honestly be the core, name both here rather
than settling on one and revisiting it later. Carry them forward together. A
choice surfaced at the end is a choice you already made for them.

*Move on when* the condition could not be mistaken for a proposed solution.

**2. Bound what you are defining.** A label often encodes several problems.
"Teenage pregnancy" can mean morality, life chances, cost to the taxpayer or
social disintegration. Push for one primary focus; take a second only if it is
simple enough to carry. Where the user has several statements in play, check for
overlap: if two describe the same issue at different levels, say so and push
them to merge, separate or nest them.

*Move on when* you are both working on one identified thing at one identified
level.

**3. Identify who is affected.** Who experiences this, where, and do some groups
experience it differently? Push back on broad labels that hide variation, such
as "businesses", "residents", "young people".

*Move on when* the affected population, place, sector or system is specific
enough to appear in the statement.

**4. Establish scale and time.** Every assertion of too much or too little
should carry a number. How big is "too big"? A point estimate with a range is
often best: *~250,000 homeless persons in families, plausibly 100,000-400,000*.

If no number exists, name the metric that would measure the condition. This
makes the definition concrete and behavioural: prefer *too many people with
incomes over £60,000 in subsidised housing* to *too many well-off people in
public housing*. If the data do not exist, say so, say what would settle it, and
leave a marked placeholder: `[add magnitude]`, `[add affected group]`,
`[add time period]`, `[add evidence for causal claim]`,
`[add baseline or comparator]`.

State a time horizon wherever the problem is prospective. Treat any unquantified
claim as provisional.

Where the problem is a hierarchy, ask for a metric or observable indicator for
each sub-problem. A sub-problem carrying no indicator is a claim and should be
visible as one.

*Move on when* the statement can point to a scale, a trend or a named future
risk, with gaps marked rather than filled.

**5. Test the public-problem basis.** A problem asserts that something is wrong,
and "wrong" is contestable. Ask what makes this more than a private
inconvenience. `house-rules` carries the tests. If no basis can be located, say
plainly that this may not be a problem public intervention can or should
address, and do not soften it.

*Move on when* a credible public-interest basis is stated, or you have flagged
clearly that it needs strengthening.

**6. Read the framing through value, capacity and support.** Ask which of the
three is weakest here: that the goal is not clearly valuable, that it cannot
realistically be delivered, that it lacks the backing it needs, or that these
pull against each other. Where the user is choosing between framings, make the
cost explicit. What sharpens public value often narrows deliverability or weakens
support. That trade-off is the point of this move, and it is why it belongs here
rather than at the end.

*Move on when* the user has a plausible reading of where the strain sits and
what their framing costs them.

**7. Strip hidden solutions and test causal claims.** The statement must not
contain a solution. The tip-off: if you catch yourself thinking *"but that's not
the real problem"*, a solution has probably been smuggled in.

| Do not say | Why it fails | Try instead |
|---|---|---|
| "There is too little shelter for homeless families." | Pre-commits to building shelter; blocks prevention. | "Too many families are homeless." |
| "New schools are being built too slowly." | Pre-commits to building schools; blocks reuse and distance learning. | "There are too many schoolchildren relative to available classroom space." |

Then take the causal language. Treat "because", "driven by" and "due to" as
hypotheses unless the user has evidence, and soften unsupported ones to "may
contribute".

A cause can legitimately *be* the problem, as in *states will not enforce engine
maintenance* behind air pollution. That is powerful because it points towards
action. But it is diagnostic, not descriptive: it smuggles in a causal claim, and
the word "definition" can shield that claim from scrutiny. Accept it only where
the causal chain has been evaluated and is believed real. Otherwise mark the link
as a claim needing evidence and ask whether the cause has been overstated.

*Move on when* the wording pre-commits to nothing and every causal claim is
either evidenced or marked.

**8. Settle the framing choice.** The competing framings should already be on the
table from move 1. This is where they are resolved, not raised. Put each next to
what move 6 says it costs, in value, deliverability and backing, and let the user
choose. One or two variants, never a survey. If they do not choose, that is a
result: record it as contested.

*Move on when* the user has chosen, or has decided to leave it open and recorded
as contested.

**9. Draft, critique, revise, read out.** When enough is in hand, give four
things in this order, each labelled so the user can find it:

1. **Candidate statement.** One or two sentences, in their register.
2. **Critique.** What is still weak and what would fix it. Name the failures; do
   not narrate them. Four failures is four short claims, not four paragraphs.
3. **Revised statement.** One or two sentences, with every placeholder spelled
   out immediately after it: what to supply and where it would come from.
4. **Readout.** Four labelled lines: *public value*, *operational capacity*,
   *political support*, *key trade-off*. One or two sentences each. The
   trade-off line earns its place by saying what this framing costs rather than
   summarising the other three.

Critique before revision. The user should see why a frame is weak before being
handed the fix.

**Length is part of the output.** A reader who has to excavate the four parts
from continuous prose has been given a worse answer however good the analysis
underneath. That is the failure this move actually hit on its first real test.

Where the user has several linked issues, and a hierarchy always counts, add a
compact problem system map: *core problem*, *evidence*, *sub-problems*,
*mechanisms*, *constraints*, *missing metrics*. A line or two each.

If key details are still missing, do not force a draft. Say what is missing and
ask the next best question. Ending on a single question is almost always right,
even after a full draft. The draft is a probe, not a delivery.

*Move on when* the user has a statement they can work from. It stays
provisional.

## What a strong statement looks like

One or two sentences. Evaluative. Quantified where possible. No hidden solution.
No unverified cause. A condition, not a programme. Usually:

> [deficit or excess] + [quantified magnitude or named metric] + [affected
> population or scope] + [time horizon, if relevant]

## Boundaries and handoffs

Continue the work rather than announcing a handoff. Never say "now invoke the
evidence skill". Say what the analysis now turns on and carry on into it.

- The frame depends on a factual or causal claim nobody has tested, so go to
  `evidence`.
- No responsible frame can be written because the condition, what affected people
  actually encounter, or the mechanism is genuinely unknown, so the next move is
  inquiry, not another draft. That is `evidence` and the learning question inside
  it.
- The framing turns on the interests or power of specific actors, so go to
  `stakeholders`. "Who is affected" stays here; motivations, resources, arena and
  relationships belong there.
- The user wants to know what to do, so go to `options`. Stripping a hidden
  solution out of a statement is not the same as generating alternatives.

## Self-check

Run before returning any drafted or revised statement. This is also the scoring
list: when asked to score a statement, return pass or fail against each
criterion with a reason on every fail.

**Must pass, block on any failure:**

- states a deficit, an excess or a concerning trend, or is a legitimate
  decision, invention or opportunity exception
- contains no implicit solution, and passes the "that's not the real problem"
  test
- any causal claim is marked as a claim, not asserted as fact
- roughly one to two sentences; describes a condition, not a programme

**Should pass, name the gap if missing:**

- carries a magnitude: a number, a range, or at minimum a named metric, with
  placeholders marked rather than figures supplied
- has a public-problem basis you could articulate if challenged
- states a time horizon where the problem is prospective
- uses "the odds" where the problem is probabilistic
- identifies the key trade-off across value, capacity and support

## Failure modes

- **Accepting a solution as a problem.** The most common and most expensive: it
  silently rules out every answer except the one already assumed. Challenge on
  the first turn, not after an interview.
- **Missing the hierarchy.** Treating a tangle of condition, mechanism, symptom
  and cost as one problem, and defining whichever part was written down most
  confidently.
- **Silently picking a framing.** Collapsing a real condition-versus-cause
  choice, or resolving a contested framing without showing the trade-off.
- **Forcing deficit or excess** onto a well-structured decision or an invention
  challenge where it does not fit.
- **Marching the sequence** when the user arrived with half of it answered.
- **Burying the four-part output** in prose, or filing it as a document. Both
  are the same failure.
- **Treating a label as one problem** when it encodes several, or letting two
  statements at different levels sit side by side unexamined.
- **Turning definition into research design.** Naming what would settle a gap is
  this skill's job. Designing the study is not.
